      <h1>Triangles</h1>
      <h2>The different types of triangles</h2>
      <h3>Equilateral triangles</h3>

        <p>In geometry, an equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal. In the familiar Euclidean geometry, equilateral triangles are also equiangular; that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60Â°.</p>

      <h3>Isosceles Triangles</h3>
        <img class="Isosceles" src="Photos/isosceles.png" alt="Image of a Isosceles triangle">
        <p>An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides. In the figure above, the two equal sides have length b and the remaining side has length a. This property is equivalent to two angles of the triangle being equal. An isosceles triangle therefore has both two equal sides and two equal angles. The name derives from the Greek iso (same) and skelos (leg).

      <h3>Scalene triangle</h3>

        <p>Scalene triangles are triangles with three sides of different lengths. The math term for sides of different triangles is noncongruent sides, so you may also see this phrase in your math book. For example, a triangle with side lengths of 2 cm, 3 cm, and 4 cm would be a scalene triangle. A triangle with side lengths of 2 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm would not be scalene, since two of the sides have the same length.</p>
